{"src": "write a positive drug review: ", "trg": "\"never had any crazy side effects from this, no bleeding, no spotting, but i would get more of an increased appetite which is helpful for someone like myself taking adderall. it helps balance out my hunger because adderall makes you not hungry, and this birth control does give me that appetite i need. i have taken it for years. 2 months ago i had refilled my mili tablets online, however, instead of giving me my regular mili tablets that i am used to, walgreens has instead decided to give me another birth control for my refill called estarylla. since taking this new birth control i hate it! now i\u2019m spotty, and i\u2019m not hungry now even without taking adderall. i have absolutely no appetite, so now i am on here reviewing this birth control because it makes me realize how grateful i am for what mili tablets have done for me throughout the years compared to this new birth control! with mili tablets, the pros are i have not had really any bad side effects, the pill is small, so it\u2019s easy to swallow.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t", "label": 1}
